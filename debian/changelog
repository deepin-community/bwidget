bwidget (1.8.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer Debian Tcl/Tk Packagers
    <pkg-tcltk-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org>.
  
  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Moved all tcl scripts to /usr/share/tcltk to make the package compliant
    to Debian Tcl/Tk policy (closes: #434394).
  * Replaced Build-Depends-Indep by Build-Depends, because clean target
    requires Build-Depends.

    window. Otherwise buttons with text longer than 8 characters look
    awful.
  * Use quilt for patch management.
  * Register HTML docs in doc-base.
  * Bumped standards version to 3.7.3.
  * Bumped debhelper compatibility level to 5.

  [ Francesco Paolo Lovergine ]

bwidget (1.6.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * This is the `reasonable changelog' release (thanks to Brian Nelson
    <pyro@debian.org>).
  * Build dependency on debhelper now added (closes: #70184).
  * Spelling errors fixed in the description. I think the errors are
    debatable but it's probably better to keep the peace (closes: #124472).
  * Documentation is up to date as per upstream package; package
    installation directory has same version number as package
    (closes: #147059).
  * It *is* the current upstream version of the package, so for the time
    being there should be nothing to complain about (closes: #159971).
  * Images go to /usr/share/bwidget1.6.0 since they are
    architecture-independent. This makes Lintian happy.
